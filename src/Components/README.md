# Workout Log 

Both a learning project and actual tool I needed in my day to day life, this lightweight workout log is a great solution for those us putting in some time at the gym. ðŸ’ª

I built this to get better using React. Didn't want to confused myself any further, so I kept Flux/Redux out of it this go around. Will make sure to add that stuff in for my next React project.

That being said, this was a great learning experience! I can see why people like using React. I have more thoughts to add but it's getting late.
